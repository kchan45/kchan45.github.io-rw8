# A Short Bio

I was born and raised in a suburb just south of Atlanta, Georgia. As I grew up, I became increasingly interested in new and emerging technology. I graduated high school in 2014 with a strong interest in STEM. Later that year, I began my undergraduate carreer at the Georgia Institute of Technology, majoring in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. As an undergraduate, I became interested in coding as it applied to science and engineering, which led to the addition of a minor in Scientific and Engineering computing. In addition during my time at Georgia Tech, I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant, a peer tutor, and an undergraduate researcher. As an undergraduate researcher, I worked in [Professor Martin Maldovan](https://www.chbe.gatech.edu/people/martin-maldovan)'s group with [Dr. Juan Manuel Restrepo-Florez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VLMa-k0AAAAJ&hl=en), where I worked on modeling a pipe-in-pipe reactor  using COMSOL for the production of syn gas. I graduated in the spring semester of 2018 with Highest Honors.

I spent a year after college to focus on exploring options for my future. As I was applying to jobs, I found that I had a stronger desire to keep learning and to keep up with the latest and cutting-edge technology. In that regard, I decided to pursue graduate school to feed my hunger for the latest and greatest. I moved across the country to pursue a PhD in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. At Cal, I am pursuing research with [Professor Ali Mesbah](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/cbe/mesbah) on the development of learning-based control and optimization for low-temperature plasmas, which have variety of applications ranging from materials processing to biomedical treatments.

In my spare time, Explore northern California and the Bay area and delve into new hobbies and projects, including, but not limited to 3-D printing trinkets and gadgets, building mechanical keyboards, and trying out new food and recipes.


_California has some of the best outdoor landscapes:_
